<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello My name is Chad Bartlett, I am an aspiring web developer<br/> who is currently enrolled in a full-stack web developer<br/> program 
  hoping it will allow me to learn all the neccesary skills<br/> in order to some day work for a company as a web developer.
</p>
<p>I grew up playing on computers and as I grew older I started to enjoy<br/> taking them apart and adding new parts, 
  Not long after I got curious<br/> about how programs were made and saw all the job opportunites on the<br/> rise. After
  doing research online I found a course on Udemy by<br/> Dr.Angela Yu and got started. I have learned so much already
  and I<br/> cannot wait to see what else I can do.
